		<div style="text-align: center;"><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=5>Welcome to my webpage! This is a documentation of my coding skills and my photography.<br>
		I have wanted to learn to code for a long time and have decided to jump in head first. This is my first attempt at any sort of major coding effort.<br>
		 I know my code is very rudimentary, but I am progressively becoming happy with my efforts.<br>
		 My photography, on the other hand, seemed to come naturally. I have noticed that I have had a strong passion for landscapes. <br>
		 I wish to buy a camera of my own someday and also wish to purchase a legitimately good computer someday to help in that effort.</FONT></div>
