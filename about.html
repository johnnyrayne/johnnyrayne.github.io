	<h4 style="color:white" style="text-align:center;">This is my amateur photography portfolio.
		I have been taking photographs for a short time, but only as a hobby. I decided that I should start
		documenting my efforts and eventually take it more seriously.<br>
		I have practiced so many different hobbies in my life, but not have quite struck my as well as photography and shooting guns.<br> For some reason, both of these have been quite effective in calming me down. Both are cost prohibitive, unfortunately and therefore have been difficult for me to utilize in my daily life.<br> Most of these pictures are from opportunities I have had to borrow a camera and shoot to my heart's desire.</h4>
